# Decentralizeable

Creating a list of existing technology that is or can be decentralized. Frameworks of thinking about decentralization. etc.

Decentralizing is about composability. 
It is about decoupling and undocking aspects of tech on the edges of governance. Along the lines of "decisions made in the system and who needs to make them".
